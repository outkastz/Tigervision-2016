# Tigervision-2016
Old version of Tigervision Baseball package. It wasn't pretty, but it worked!

Supported headshots, stats, read tweets, post tweets, bottom line, and some basic scoreboard functions. If I were to build it again I'd do it very differently.

It was originally made for baseball and parts were used during football. It was the full control center for our sports broadcasting.
